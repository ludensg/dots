    <p style="line-height: 2">
        An invitation to explore your relationship to the consumption, generation, understanding, and witnessing of information, knowledge, and art,
        based upon a set of core principles to delimit its purpose and approach.
    </p>

    <h2 id="principles">Core Principles</h2>
    <p>
        <ol style="line-height: 3">
            <li><b>Impermanence:</b> The Wikipedia Eye is a <b>transient marker</b>.
                A Wikipedia Eye art piece ceases to exist physically after it has fulfilled it's purpose of interacting with the flow of information,
                as the eye itself is then transduced into information.
                What's left behind in it's wake (i.e. a painting), is just a trace of it's previous physical container.</li>
            <li><b>Persistence:</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_(computer_science)">Persistence</a> in computer science refers to the characteristic of state of a system that outlives (persists more than) the process that created it. 
                In hardware storage, this refers to the ability of data to remain stored and intact even when the storage device
                is not powered. This means that the data will still be accessible the next time the device is powered on.
                Common examples of persistent storage devices include hard drives, SSDs, USB drives, and optical discs.
                In contrast, RAM (Random Access Memory) in computers is a form of non-persistent storage, as its contents are lost when the power is turned off.
                The Wikipedia Eye concept relies upon a process of transducing physical artifacts of ephemeral importance (i.e. paintings)
                into persistent (and, if possible, relevant) information.</li>
            <li><b>Connection:</b> In the spirit of the Wikimedia Movement, The Wikipedia Eye celebrates the connection with like-minded indivudals present, past, and future.</li>
            <li><b>Open Access:</b> Just as Wikipedia believes in free access to the sum of all human knowledge,
                The Wikipedia Eye encourages open dialogue, interpretation, and understanding. And as such, efforts need to be made in order to 
            raise information from a state of unknowningness, up to a level of accessibility.</li>
            <li><b>Action:</b> Even though The Wikipedia Eye isn't a form of activism, it exists in appreciation, and in consequence, of the doing of important things.</li>
